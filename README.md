GDP is in the process of rewriting its job ads checkout system. You have been assigned to build this new system. We want to offer different products to recruiters:

(i) Classic Ad : Offers the most basic level of advertisement.

(i) Standout Ad : Allows advertisers to use a company logo and use a longer presentation text.

(iii) Premium Ad : Same benefits as Standout Ad, but also puts the advertisement at the top of the results, allowing higher visibility.

Each of the product is billed as follows:

ID	Name	Price
